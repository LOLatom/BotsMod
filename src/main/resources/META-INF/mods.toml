Bane Of The Souls yes.... A long time ago the nether was a beneath world , a world only populated by many greenish feature , same complexity as the 'Overworld' just sometime a little bit more twisted , That twist was caused by 3 primal Crystals mainly called by the name ('(Delta, Eldritch, Heat)'Those are called primordial crystal cause they were the first, and so same as the plant , they evolved)
                          Every form of life on this Strange place was evolved to be able to live in those caverns, some emitted light, some hided from the light , and well some denied the light.
                          Those many forms of evolution leaded to a new type of Fauna and Flora, many concept were created by many evolved forms of life , At this point they were more evolved then a current villager or player , in their own ways .
                          But this verdish place , took a bad turn , many forms of life empty their souls and banished them, to gain more power over some, forcing them to do the same, rare were the survivors , they just evolved in their new hellish environment and became many of the creatures we see in the nether now .

                          Good thing tho since i made that the player can go back to the old dimension now called The Banned Lands
                          With the help of the time Goddess Krasía (Pronunciation: [Kræshïa]) , you'll be able to know how to achieve this journey to The Banned Lands, defeating the gate keeper and creating a way to The Banned Lands to find out what this new dimension can offer you .
